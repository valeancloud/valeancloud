**👋 Hi there, I'm Andrews, a Cloud Computing Engineer**

I’m a self‑driven cloud engineer who learns best by getting my hands dirty. I love spinning up systems in AWS, tearing them down, and rebuilding them just to see how they behave in the real world. I’m always experimenting with new ideas, breaking things on purpose, and figuring out smarter ways to put them back together. Most of my work revolves around designing secure, scalable, and automated infrastructure while pushing myself toward more advanced AWS certifications.

## **🚀 What I Do**

Currently, I’m practicing cloud engineering through personal projects and labs, with recent work including:

- Launching and configuring EC2 instances and VPC networking
- Setting up S3 buckets and managing storage permissions
- Configuring Lambda functions for simple serverless tasks
- Implementing basic security using IAM roles and policies
- Monitoring resources with CloudWatch metrics and alarms
- Deploying containerized apps using ECS Fargate
- Hosting static websites on S3 with CloudFront
- Experimenting with API Gateway for serverless endpoints

## **🔧 My Toolbox**
### ☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure
- ☁️ **AWS:** EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, Lambda, CloudWatch, DynamoDB, ECR  
- 🐳 **Containerization:** Docker, ECS Fargate  
- 🛰️ **Serverless:** Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions  
- 🏗️ **IaC:** Terraform

### 🛠️ DevOps & Automation
- 🤖 **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins  
- 🔄 **Config Management:** Ansible  
- 📈 **Monitoring & Logging:** CloudWatch, Grafana, OpenSearch  

### 🧰 Tools & Practices
- 🗂️ **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- 🤝 **Agile Workflow:** Jira, Confluence  
- 🧩 **Architecture Design:** Markdown-based diagrams, Mermaid

## 💬 A Bit More About Me
- Hands-on cloud learner who builds by experimenting and breaking things down.
- Focused on AWS architecture, automation, and real-world cloud patterns.
- Growing my Python skills for AWS scripting and workflow automation.
- AWS Cloud Practitioner + SAA; working toward Solutions Architect – Professional.

## 📚 Projects & Learning
- Recreating real-world AWS environments to understand architecture behavior.
- Building with Terraform, event-driven designs, and containerized workloads.
- Exploring advanced AWS services like Step Functions, KMS, and CloudTrail.
- Preparing for additional AWS certifications to deepen expertise.
