**👋 Hi there, I'm Andrews, a Cloud Computing Engineer.**

I’m a self-driven cloud engineer building hands-on experience with AWS and DevOps practices. I focus on designing secure, scalable, and automated infrastructure while studying for advanced certifications. I enjoy experimenting with real-world projects to strengthen my cloud architecture skills.

🚀 What I Do

Currently, I’m practicing cloud engineering through personal projects and labs, with recent work including:

- Launching and configuring EC2 instances and VPC networking
- Setting up S3 buckets and managing storage permissions
- Configuring Lambda functions for simple serverless tasks
- Implementing basic security using IAM roles and policies
- Monitoring resources with CloudWatch metrics and alarms
- Deploying containerized apps using ECS Fargate
- Hosting static websites on S3 with CloudFront
- Experimenting with API Gateway for serverless endpoints
